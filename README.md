# üè† ALX Listing App

The **ALX Listing App** is a modern, responsive, and scalable web application inspired by platforms like Airbnb. Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it showcases dynamic property listings with detailed views, reusable components, and mock API integration.

This project serves as a foundation for learning, experimentation, or scaling into a full-featured real estate platform.
